## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Improvements:
1. **Email Recommendations** - Send PDF with recommendations
2. **Regenerate Button** - Allow user to request new recommendations
3. **Feedback System** - Ask "Was this helpful?"
4. **Export to PDF** - Include recommendations in PDF report
5. **Action Tracking** - Let users check off completed recommendations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Recommendations don't load
**Solution:**
1. Check dev server is running: http://localhost:3001
2. Check database is running
3. Check API key in `.env.local`: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Loading takes too long (>60s)
**Solution:**
1. Check Gemini API status
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check if prompt is too large (should be ~9,500 chars)

### Issue: Recommendations are cached but user wants new ones
**Solution:**
Send request with `forceRegenerate`:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "session_xxx",
  "language": "en",
  "forceRegenerate": true
}
```
